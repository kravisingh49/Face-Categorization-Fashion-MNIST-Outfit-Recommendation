Welcome to the **Face Categorization & Fashion MNIST Outfit Recommendation** project! This notebook combines the power of image processing techniques with deep learning datasets to categorize facial images and recommend stylish outfits from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It's an exciting blend of computer vision, machine learning, and creativity!

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:
1. **Categorize facial images** from the CelebA dataset based on certain visual features such as edge density, contrast, and brightness.
2. **Recommend appropriate outfits** from the Fashion MNIST dataset based on the categorized facial images.
3. **Enhance the quality of Fashion MNIST images** through advanced image processing techniques to ensure they look sharp and professional.
4. **Visualize the results** in a high-quality, innovative format that is both informative and visually appealing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Image Processing**: Utilize techniques like edge detection, histogram equalization, and noise reduction to process and enhance images.
- **Heuristic-Based Categorization**: Implement a custom heuristic approach to categorize facial images based on their visual characteristics.
- **Outfit Recommendation**: Match categorized facial images to the most suitable outfits from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **High-Quality Visualization**: Display the results in an innovative and aesthetically pleasing format using Matplotlib.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Data Setup**: Load and preprocess the CelebA and Fashion MNIST datasets.
- **Image Categorization**: Categorize facial images using edge detection, contrast analysis, and brightness assessment.
- **Outfit Recommendation**: Recommend the best outfit for each categorized facial image using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Image Enhancement**: Enhance the quality of Fashion MNIST images to ensure they are sharp and clear.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the categorized faces and recommended outfits side by side.

## üíª How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kravisingh49/Face-Categorization-Fashion-MNIST-Outfit-Recommendation.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary Python packages installed. You can use the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `Face Categorization & Fashion MNIST Outfit Recommendation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run the cells step by step to see the magic happen!
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Face Categorization & Fashion MNIST Outfit Recommendation.ipynb
   ```

4. **Explore the Results**: The notebook will generate a series of visualizations and an output text file with the recommendations.

## üìä Example Outputs

- **Categorized Facial Images**: Each facial image from the CelebA dataset is categorized as either formal, semi-formal, or casual based on its visual features.
- **Recommended Outfits**: For each categorized face, an appropriate outfit from the Fashion MNIST dataset is recommended.
- **Enhanced MNIST Images**: The recommended outfits are enhanced for clarity and sharpness, ensuring they look top-notch.

## üé® Visualization

The results are displayed in a grid format, with facial images in one row and their corresponding outfit recommendations in another. The layout is designed to be both informative and visually appealing, making it easy to compare faces with their recommended outfits.
