# üé® **Fashion Recommender with Deep Learning** üëó

Welcome to the **Fashion Recommender** project! This repository showcases an innovative approach to style categorization and outfit recommendation using deep learning. By leveraging the CelebA and Fashion MNIST datasets, we build a system that understands facial features and suggests outfits based on these features.

## üåü **Key Features**

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize facial images into different style categories.
- **Data Processing**: Handles large-scale image datasets, including resizing, normalization, and preprocessing.
- **Visualizations**: Includes insightful visualizations of the data, training process, and model predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

### **1. Data Setup**
- **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images.
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of 70,000 fashion product images across 10 categories.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **CelebA**: Images resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized for model input.
- **Fashion MNIST**: Fashion images resized and reshaped to match the CNN input format.

### **3. Model Architecture**
- **CNN Layers**: Combines Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers for feature extraction and classification.
- **Optimizer**: `Adam` optimizer with `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss.

### **4. Model Training**
- Trained on a subset of the CelebA dataset with 35 epochs.
- Validation split set to 20% to monitor overfitting and performance.

### **5. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Monitored using training and validation accuracy.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the model's performance across different categories.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Provides detailed performance metrics for each class.

## üîß **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Data Imbalance**: Addressed potential class imbalance issues.
- **Image Resolution**: Improved image clarity by resizing to higher resolution.
- **Model Overfitting**: Controlled by monitoring validation metrics.

## üí° **Future Enhancements**
- **Model Improvement**: Explore more advanced architectures and transfer learning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and more.
- **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve generalization.

## üìù **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning to fashion recommendation. The system effectively categorizes facial images and suggests appropriate outfits, showcasing a powerful blend of technology and style.
